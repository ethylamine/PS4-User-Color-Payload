# PS4-User-Color-Payload
Change default user color from blue to 3 other colors (Red, Green, and Pink)

Ugly old code with old RE notes
Currently only supports firmware 5.05 (leads to OOM error for 9.00)
Feel free to submit PRs for additional firmware support
Only works for bluetooth connected controllers
